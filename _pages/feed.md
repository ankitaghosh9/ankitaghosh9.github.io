*Fascinating ideas that I read*

## 	10th Oct 2021, 03:30 AM
Read another Andrej Karpathy's blog - [Short Story on AI](http://karpathy.github.io/2021/03/27/forward-pass/) and it was mindblowing! <br>*Will add my thoughts soon!*

### Intro
Andrej Karpathy apart from being the director of AI and Autopilot Vision at Tesla and standing as the singular [human benchmark for ImageNet dataset](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/09/02/what-i-learned-from-competing-against-a-convnet-on-imagenet/) (yeah he classified all the images into 1000 classes after training for months!). 
He is very famous for his [blogs](http://karpathy.github.io/), specifically: [A Recipe for Training Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) (inspired by his famous "most common neural network mistakes" tweet) and [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). For a long time I wanted to read these blogs in its entirety and wasn't able to do it. This morning while taking a walk in the garden I decide to read the former blog: A Recipe for Training Neural Networks, and it was amazing!
### Motivation
He mentions 2 main ideas that motivated him to write this blog - Neural net training is a leaky abstraction, Neural net training fails silently. He is who coined the term Programming 2.0 which encompasses this field of "Data-Driven Programming" (as George Hotz called it) where the directions of the program and results switch as compared to traditional programming:

### Most fascinating take away
*Will add this soon! Spoiler: it's related to the advice of permute vs view in torch*
