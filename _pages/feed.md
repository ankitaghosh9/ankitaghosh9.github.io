## Poetry and Articles
  - You can find some of my poetry on my instagram page: [@blotting.paper](https://www.instagram.com/blotting.paper/) (I have been on a hiatus for a while, from instagram not poetry :))
  - My articles on [Manipal The Talk Network](https://www.manipalthetalk.org/) are currently down as they have shifted platforms. Some of my captions to their social media:  [1](https://www.instagram.com/p/CHNvszoBnJT/?igshid=190x8s047hz6c) [2](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJ3pK43BpJB/?igshid=1jehsxk3xr2a5) [3](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CFAHNLgBf05/?igshid=meha1h0nyid6)

## Talk
  -  [Introduction to Computer Vision](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LeJ-VOzK08jvw6ILYycikIZNcGpssCQO) <br> A talk given by me as a part of the 'Birds of a Feather' webinar series hosted by [Research Society MIT](https://rsm-website.vercel.app/) to introduce various research fields to beginners. The talk covers the basic mathematics behind computer vision, a brief overview of CNNs, pointers to remember when it comes to data preprocessing, and discussion on some of the recent cutting-edge research papers in the field. The webinar ended with a Q&A session.

(Shoutout to [Sahil Khose's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/SahilKhose/featured) for quality paper presentations and discussions!)
