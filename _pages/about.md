Hello, I'm Sahil Khose, a senior CS undergraduate student from Manipal Institute of Technology, India. I'm currently working as a research intern at the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Lab at IISc Bangalore, in the domain of Continual Zero Shot Learning.
<br>
<br>
My research interests lies in Computer Vision, NLP, Zero Shot Learning, Semi-Supervised Learning and Generative Neural Networks. You can check out my work and the projects in my resume.
<br>
<br>
I have started a research initiative on YouTube, where I stream a research paper explanation every week. This was motivated by the lack of resources for paper explanations for a lot of niche domains which researchers might want to explore. I have posted 11 videos (by Aug 15, 2021) with 6 videos being personal presentations and 5 guest presentations. Couple of times the authors of the paper themselves have conducted the presentations!

I am always open to research collaborations, so if you want to have a discussion about the projects I have worked on or about a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail.
