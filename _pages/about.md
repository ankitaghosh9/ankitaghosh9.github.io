Hello, I’m Ankita Ghosh, an MSc Computer Science student majoring in visual and interactive computing at ETH Zürich, Switzerland. My interest lies in computer vision, particularly its applications in the digital human and healthcare domain. Currently, I am interning at Stryker in Freiburg, Germany and working on vision pipelines for surgical planning. I am also associated with the [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) headed by [Prof. Dr. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html) where I am working on the topic of human motion generation.
<br> <br>
Previously, I interned at the [Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory](https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/) at the University of Waterloo through the Mitacs Globalink Research Program on the topic of Emotion Recognition and Expression in Social Robots and at the Spectrum Lab in the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/) to devise deep learning approaches for diabetic retinopathy analysis. I have worked on medical projects involving rendering 3D anatomical parts in a virtual environment, and applications of deep learning in ophthalmology, explainable algorithms, and disaster management. My research undertakings have been accepted in IEEE conferences, and CVPR and NeurIPS workshops. 
<br> <br>
When I am not squinting my eyes at a research paper or a snippet of code, I spend my time fangirling over crime shows and Taylor Swift, watching animal videos, or penning my thoughts in rhymes and metaphors. You can check my articles in the Feed section 🖋️

I am always open to research collaborations, so if you would like to have a discussion about the projects I have worked on or about a potential collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.
