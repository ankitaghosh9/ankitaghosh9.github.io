Hello, I'm Ankita Ghosh, a 4th-year undergraduate student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering in Manipal Institute of Technology, India. My interest lies in the field of deep learning, computer vision and image processing. I am also exploring computer graphics and interaction.
<br> <br>
Currently, I am interning at the Spectrum Lab in the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/) to devise deep learning approaches for diabetic retinopathy analysis. Previously, I completed my internship at the [Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory](https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/) in the University of Waterloo through Mitacs Globalink Research Program on the topic of Emotion Recognition and Expression in Social Robots. I have worked on a medical projects like rendering 3D anatomical parts in a virtual environment, and applications of deep learning in ophthalmology. 
<br> <br>
During my undergraduate, I co-founded [the Research Society](https://www.researchsocietymit.com/) at Manipal Institute of Technology with the core aim of promoting inter-disciplinary research, publishing papers in relevant journals and international conferences along with securing funding for projects and patents. Along with this, we regularly conduct guest lectures, alumni interaction sessions and paper presentation workshops. For further information and collaborations, you can email us at <research.society.mit@gmail.com>.

When I am not squinting my eyes at a research paper or a snippet of code, I spend my time fangirling over crime shows and Taylor Swift, watching animal videos or penning my thoughts in rhymes and metaphors. You can check my articles in the Feed section üñãÔ∏è

I am always open to research collaborations, so if you want to have a discussion about the projects I have worked on or about a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail.
