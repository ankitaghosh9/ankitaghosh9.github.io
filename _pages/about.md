Hello, I am Ankita Ghosh, an MSc Computer Science student majoring in visual and interactive computing at ETH Zürich, Switzerland. My interest lies in computer vision, particularly its applications in interdisciplinary domains. Currently, I am a visiting graduate scholar at the [ARCADE lab](https://www.arcade.cs.jhu.edu/) headed by Prof. Mathias Unberath at the Johns Hopkins University.
<br> <br>
My previous academic associations include the [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) headed by Prof. Dr. Siyu Tang at ETH Zurich, the [Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory](https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/) at the University of Waterloo through the Mitacs Globalink Research Program, and the [Spectrum Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/spectrumlabeeiisc/spectrum-lab) in the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. I have industrial experience through my internship at Stryker as a Machine Vision Engineer in Freiburg, Germany. My work spans applied AI across healthcare, social robotics, model interpretability, and 3D modeling and manipulation for digital humans and robots. My research undertakings have been accepted in IEEE conferences, and CVPR and NeurIPS workshops.
<br> <br>
When I am not squinting my eyes at a research paper or a snippet of code, I spend my time reading, cooking, swinging a racket to the best of my ability (which is not the best), and mostly penning my thoughts in rhymes and metaphors. You can check my articles in the Feed section.
<br> <br>
I am always open to interdisciplinary research, so if you would like to discuss the projects I have worked on or explore a potential collaboration, feel free to email me.
