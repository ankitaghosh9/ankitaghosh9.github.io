Hello, I'm Ankita Ghosh, an MSc Computer Science student majoring in visual and interactive computing at ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland. My interest lies in the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and computer graphics. Currently, I am working on the topic of human motion generation in the [Computer Vision and Learning Group](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/) headed by [Prof. Dr. Siyu Tang](https://vlg.inf.ethz.ch/team/Prof-Dr-Siyu-Tang.html). 
<br> <br>
Previously, I interned at the [Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Laboratory](https://uwaterloo.ca/social-intelligent-robotics-research-lab/) at the University of Waterloo through the Mitacs Globalink Research Program on the topic of Emotion Recognition and Expression in Social Robots and at the Spectrum Lab in the [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](https://eecs.iisc.ac.in/) to devise deep learning approaches for diabetic retinopathy analysis. I have worked on medical projects involving rendering 3D anatomical parts in a virtual environment, and applications of deep learning in ophthalmology. My research undertakings have been accepted in IEEE conferences, and CVPR and NeurIPS workshops.

When I am not squinting my eyes at a research paper or a snippet of code, I spend my time fangirling over crime shows and Taylor Swift, watching animal videos, or penning my thoughts in rhymes and metaphors. You can check my articles in the Feed section üñãÔ∏è
<br> <br>
I am always open to research collaborations, so if you would like to have a discussion about the projects I have worked on or about a potential collaboration, feel free to drop me an email.
